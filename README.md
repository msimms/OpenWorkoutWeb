# OpenWorkoutWeb
Workout tracking website and optional companion to the Open Workout mobile app. This is very much a work-in-progress and is being done as a spare-time project, so set your expectations appropriately.

## Rationale
Why develop a workout tracker when there are so many closed-source options available?

* I needed a companion website to the mobile app of the same name that I developed. I needed this to make the live tracking feature possible.
* Other workout trackers do not support strength-based exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups (press-ups).
* I think users should have control over their own data and this is only possible with an open source application.
* There are some analytical ideas that I have which none of the major activity tracking websites perform.
* I want to do some experiments with automatically generating workout plans. This will serve as the platform for this idea.
* Education. For the experience in performing full-stack software development: dealing with website deployment and scalability, and security issues.

## Major Features
* Enables the live tracking feature of the Open Workout mobile app.
* Supports strength (lifting) activities as well as distance (aerobic) activities.

## Major Todos
* Support for strength-based activities (this is partially implemented).
* Import from other services.
* Better graphics.
* Replace Google Maps with Open Street Map.
* More analytics.

## Software Design Goals
* Incorporate as few dependencies as possible. Only add dependencies for things that are just too cumbersome or error prone to do otherwise.
* Small web pages that load quickly. This is related to the previous item regarding dependencies.

## Creating a Docker Image

**Step 1**. Clone the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/msimms/OpenWorkoutWeb
```

**Step 2**. Build the docker image:
```
cd OpenWorkoutWeb
docker build -t openworkout -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Manual Installation

**Step 1**. Clone the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/msimms/OpenWorkoutWeb
```

**Step 2**. Install the python dependencies:
```
cd OpenWorkoutWeb
python setup.py
```

**Step 3**. Install other package dependencies, specifically `mongodb` and `rabbitmq`, which are services the application depends on:

```
#
# Example for macOS:
#

# Install mongod and start the service.
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@5.0
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

# Install rabbitmq and start the service.
brew install rabbitmq
brew services restart rabbitmq

#
# Example for Ubuntu Linux:
#

# Install mongo.
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mongodb-org
sudo systemctl start mongod.service
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Install rabbitmq.
sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user openworkout <password>
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost openworkout_vhost
sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags openworkout openworkout_tag
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p openworkout_vhost openworkout ".*" ".*" ".*"
sudo rabbitmqctl delete_user guest
sudo service rabbitmq-server start
```

## Execution
The software is designed to work within multiple frameworks. Currently, cherrypy and flask are supported.

**Option 1** To run the web service under the cherrypy framework, the wsgi option is the preferred option if the app is sitting behind a proper web server, such as ngnix:
```
python start_cherrypy.py --config openworkout.config
or
python start_cherrypy_wsgi.py --config openworkout.config
```

**Option 2** To run the web service under the flask framework:
```
python start_flask.py --config openworkout.config
```

*If a Google Maps key is not provided in the configuration file, OpenStreetMap will be used instead.*

## Architecture

The software architecture makes it possible to use this system with different front-end technologies. Also, computationally expensive analysis tasks are kept separate from the main application, communicating via RabbitMQ.

Being a web app, it requires a web framework. I have tried to keep the design flexible enough to support multiple frameworks, to both appease different audiences and also allow the software to be relevant when the fashion in web frameworks inevitably changes. To this end, it currently supports cherrypy and flask with the implementation details for each being isolated in their own modules. A wsgi front end for cherrypy is also provided.

Notable modules:

* **App.py** contains the logic for handling each page and is framework-agnostic. The page handlers for each framework call into this module.
* **Api.py** contains all of the API handlers and is also framework-agnostic. Isolating this in its own module also facilitates deploying the API as a microservice.
* **Session.py** contains the session management code. It has an abstract base class along with subclasses for cherrypy, flask, as well as a custom session manager.

The software is written in python. It was started in python2 and later converted to python3.

## Workout Plans

This feature is very much under development and will go through several iterations before being ready for general use. The idea is to use the athlete's existing data to generate workouts to help in reaching future goals.
